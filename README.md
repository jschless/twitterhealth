# Twitter Health


## Goal
We are creating a classifier for tweets to help users determine the credibility / reliability of a tweet. Ultimately, we will be able to classify tweets based on their text, associated users, and the associated tweet network. Using Twitter's streaming API, we will produce a GUI that allows a user to interact with Twitter while being warned of the potential dangers.
